# Storage on the IKIM cluster

## Classes of storage

### S3 storage

Unlike local and NFS storage, S3 storage has a advantages and some downsides. We provide in house S3 storage.

The main advantage of so called object store is speed, S3 storage is very fast but does not provide the same storage abstractions as local or NFS.
By not providing a POSIX style view of the data (Meaning that instead of typing ls,
you have to use a special client to browse the data) and not providing any locking and/or coordination semantics, S3 servers can be fast and reliable.

Data will have to be copied from S3 storage to a local disk for use, however copying is usually done a line speed allowing for 1Gigabyte per second transfers. Importantly results should be copied back from local storage (leaving out temporary data). Frequently data is packed into zip or tar.gz files before uploading.
