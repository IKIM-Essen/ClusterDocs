# Jupyter Notebook Workflow

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. Visit [Jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org) for more information.

## Starting a Jupyter server instance

To launch a Jupyter instance on the [Slurm](./slurm.md) cluster, first log into the Slurm submission node:

```sh
ssh slurmq
```

Next, either create a conda environment with the package `notebook` from the channel `conda-forge` or install the package in an existing environment.

```sh
conda create -n myproject -c conda-forge notebook
conda activate myproject
```

The Jupyter startup command must be submitted to Slurm using `srun` or `sbatch`. Here is a minimal example which launches the server on a worker node with 32 allocated CPU cores and an 8-hour deadline:

```sh
srun --time 08:00:00 --cpus-per-task=32 jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser
```

The hostname, port number and authorization token are displayed upon startup. For example:

```text
[I 06:30:19.290 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /homes/jan
[I 06:30:19.290 NotebookApp] Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5 is running at:
[I 06:30:19.290 NotebookApp] http://g1-7.ikim.uk-essen.de:8888/       ?token=d6e1289f41b1433b557c06dd78c9d716180dc2a8ea61e8a9
[I 06:30:19.290 NotebookApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/       ?token=d6e1289f41b1433b557c06dd78c9d716180dc2a8ea61e8a9
[I 06:30:19.290 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice    to     skip confirmation).
[C 06:30:19.296 NotebookApp]

   To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
       file:///homes/jan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-426528-open.html
   Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
       http://g1-7.ikim.uk-essen.de:8888/?token=d6e1289f41b1433b557c06dd78c9d716180dc2a8ea61e8a9
    or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=d6e1289f41b1433b557c06dd78c9d716180dc2a8ea61e8a9
```

The output above contains the following information:

- The hostname of the worker node: `g1-7`.
- The port number: `8888`.
- The authorization token: `d6e1289f41b1433b557c06dd78c9d716180dc2a8ea61e8a9`.

## Connecting to the remote Jupyter server

### From a browser on the local machine

Worker nodes in the cluster are not exposed to the internet. In order to reach a cluster node from a local browser, an SSH tunnel through the login node must be launched. Open a terminal and execute the following command, replacing the hostname and port number from the example with the actual values:

```sh
ssh -N -L 8888:g1-7:8888 ikim
```

This command creates an SSH tunnel such that all traffic to `localhost:8888` passes through the host `ikim` and reaches the destination `g1-7:8888`. The terminal will simply hang, indicating that the tunnel has been created.

Open a browser and paste the URL provided by Jupyter. Since the traffic needs to flow through the tunnel, replace the target host with `localhost`:

```text
http://localhost:8888/?token=d6e1289f41b1433b557c06dd78c9d716180dc2a8ea61e8a9
```

The Jupyter landing page should appear:

![Jupyter home](./assets/jupyter-home.png)

To verify that the notebook is running on the remote host and within the conda environment:

![Jupyter home](./assets/jupyter-notebook.png)

### From Visual Studio Code

Connect to the Slurm submission node as described in [Connect to a remote host][vscode-docs-connect-ssh-host]. When prompted for the target host, type `slurmq`.

From the submission node, connect to the Jupyter server as described in [Connect to a remote Jupyter server][vscode-docs-remote-jupyter]. When prompted for the URL, simply copy and paste the URL displayed in the output from `jupyter notebook`. As opposed to the browser method, in this case the connection originates from inside the cluster and there's no need to set up port forwarding.

## First Time Setup

If you have not used Jupyter (or JupyterLab) on the cluster before, you will need to initialize your config files and profile.[^1] This will generate new configuration files in `~/.jupyter` and `~/.ipython` for you.

[^1]: This section is based on <https://docs.hpc.sussex.ac.uk/apollo2/jupyter.html#first-time-setup-and-nfs-issue>

```sh
jupyter notebook --generate-config
jupyter lab --generate-config # if you use jupyterlab
ipython profile create
```

There is an issue that affects all Jupyter sessions where Jupyter and Ipython data directories reside on NFS mounts (specifically any of your research volumes or your HPC home directory). By default, Jupyter uses your home directory to store a couple of SQLite databases. However, due to an issue with file locking, SQLite is known to misbehave on some NFS mounts (see [here](https://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q5)).

**How the problem presents itself:**
Your Jupyter sessions will simply hang and become unresponsive, as it will be stuck waiting for the SQLite databasesâ€™ files to be locked, which is not supported over NFS home directories.

**How to resolve the issue**
You will need to tell Jupyter and Ipython to use memory to store the database information instead of creating a file in your home directory. This can be done by editing the configuration files for Jupyter and Ipython. (Which you may have just created by following the instructions above).

```sh
# Edit Jupyter configuration
vi ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py

# Change following line
# c.NotebookNotary.db_file = ''

# To:
c.NotebookNotary.db_file = ':memory:'
```

```sh
# Edit IPython configuration
vi ~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py

# Change following two lines
# c.HistoryManager.hist_file=''
# c.HistoryAccessor.hist_file=''

# To:
c.HistoryManager.hist_file=':memory:'
c.HistoryAccessor.hist_file=':memory:'
```

```sh
# Edit JupyterLab configuration
vi ~/.jupyter/jupyter_lab_config.py

# Add the following line
c.NotebookNotary.db_file = ':memory:'
```
