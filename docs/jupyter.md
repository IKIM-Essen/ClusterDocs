# Jupyter Notebook Workflow

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. Visit [Jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org) for more information.

## Starting a Jupyter server instance

To launch a Jupyter instance on the [Slurm](./slurm.md) cluster, first log into the Slurm submission node:

```sh
ssh slurmq
```

Next, either create a conda environment with the package `notebook` from the channel `conda-forge` or install the package in an existing environment.

```sh
conda create -n myproject -c conda-forge notebook
conda activate myproject
```

The Jupyter startup command must be submitted to Slurm using `srun` or `sbatch`. Here is a minimal example which launches the server on a worker node with 32 allocated CPU cores and an 8-hour deadline:

```sh
srun --time 08:00:00 --cpus-per-task=32 jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser
```

The hostname, port number and authorization token are displayed upon startup. For example:

```text
[I 06:30:19.290 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /homes/jan
[I 06:30:19.290 NotebookApp] Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5 is running at:
[I 06:30:19.290 NotebookApp] http://g1-7.ikim.uk-essen.de:8888/       ?token=d6e1289f41b1433b557c06dd78c9d716180dc2a8ea61e8a9
[I 06:30:19.290 NotebookApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/       ?token=d6e1289f41b1433b557c06dd78c9d716180dc2a8ea61e8a9
[I 06:30:19.290 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice    to     skip confirmation).
[C 06:30:19.296 NotebookApp]

   To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
       file:///homes/jan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-426528-open.html
   Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
       http://g1-7.ikim.uk-essen.de:8888/?token=d6e1289f41b1433b557c06dd78c9d716180dc2a8ea61e8a9
    or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=d6e1289f41b1433b557c06dd78c9d716180dc2a8ea61e8a9
```

The output above contains the following information:

- The hostname of the worker node: `g1-7`.
- The port number: `8888`.
- The authorization token: `d6e1289f41b1433b557c06dd78c9d716180dc2a8ea61e8a9`.

## Connecting to the remote Jupyter server

### From a browser on the local machine

Worker nodes in the cluster are not exposed to the internet. In order to reach a cluster node from a local browser, an SSH tunnel through the login node must be launched. Open a terminal and execute the following command, replacing the hostname and port number from the example with the actual values:

```sh
ssh -N -L 8888:g1-7:8888 ikim
```

This command creates an SSH tunnel such that all traffic to `localhost:8888` passes through the host `ikim` and reaches the destination `g1-7:8888`. The terminal will simply hang, indicating that the tunnel has been created.

Open a browser and paste the URL provided by Jupyter. Since the traffic needs to flow through the tunnel, replace the target host with `localhost`:

```text
http://localhost:8888/?token=d6e1289f41b1433b557c06dd78c9d716180dc2a8ea61e8a9
```

The Jupyter landing page should appear:

To verify that the notebook is running on the remote host and within the conda environment:

![Jupyter home](./assets/jupyter-notebook.png)

### From Visual Studio Code

Connect to the Slurm submission node as described in [Connect to a remote host][vscode-docs-connect-ssh-host]. When prompted for the target host, type `slurmq`.

From the submission node, connect to the Jupyter server as described in [Connect to a remote Jupyter server][vscode-docs-remote-jupyter]. When prompted for the URL, simply copy and paste the URL displayed in the output from `jupyter notebook`. As opposed to the browser method, in this case the connection originates from inside the cluster and there's no need to set up port forwarding.
